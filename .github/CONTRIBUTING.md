## Contributing <a name="contributing"></a>
Freeside welcome contributions to these lists from staff and students at the University of Hull, as well as members of the public. If you wish to contribute, please abide by the following rules:

- Fork the repository, look at the markdown and understand it. 
- Make your changes and double check that nothing is broken.
  - Check that your entry hasn't already been added to the repository, as well as checking issues and PRs that may suggest your entry will be denied before committing your changes.
  - Any new category created must have a minimum of 3 items. If not, your addition must be inserted into `Other interesting stuff ` instead.
- Make sure your commit message(s) are descriptive.
- Make a pull request and request a review from the Freeside team.
