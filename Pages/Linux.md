# Linux Resources

## Linux Distributions <a name="linux"></a>

- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) - Great starting distributions for beginners as lots of support is available.
- [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) - Freeside uses this in our Lab!
- [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) - Advanced distribution for those looking to expand their knowledge of Linux.
- [Anarchy](https://anarchyinstaller.gitlab.io/) - This is a menu/graphical installers for Arch linux, can be useful for those wanting to try out Arch without doing everything from the command line.
- [Artix](https://artixlinux.org/) - A systemd-free alternative to Arch.
- [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/) - Ubuntu with an alternative desktop environment (KDE).
- [Lubuntu](https://lubuntu.me) - Ubuntu using LXQT, a lightweight alternative to other desktop environments.
- [Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) - Another variant of Ubuntu, great for those familiar with Windows.
- [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html) - A portable distribution that runs only in memory, for the ultimate privacy protection.
- [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/intro/) - A reasonably secure operating system. _Recommended by Edward Snowden_
- [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org) - For use with the range of Raspberry Pi single board computers. A great distribution if you're looking to get into programming (and don't mind spending a bit of money on the hardware to run it), especially involving Python or electronics (the Pis can come with GPIO pins for use with electronics). There are some beginner projects listed on the site but there are a lot of projects made by the Pi community.
- [Rescatux](https://www.supergrubdisk.org/rescatux/) - An Debian based os which has utilities to help repair potentially broken Linux or Windows systems as well as boot loaders.
